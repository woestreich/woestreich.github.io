Migratory species present unique challenges and opportunities for both ecologists and resource managers. This is particularly true for oceanic predators migrating on enormous scales through highly-dynamic habitats. In my research, I explore many elements of such migratory behavior:

  \- Environmental and oceanographic processes influencing migration 

  \- The role of social information and collective behavior in migration 

  \- Tools for observing migratory behavior across scales  

  \- Dynamic resource management for protection of migratory species and human activities

I currently conduct this research as a PhD Candidate at [Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University](https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/), where I am the David and Lucile Packard Foundation Stanford Graduate Fellow and a NSF Graduate Research Fellow. My PhD research builds upon my previous work with the the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Natural Resources Defense Council.
