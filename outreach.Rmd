Outreach and education have been large components of my academic career to date. My two major current outreach programs are described below (see CV for a complete list of outreach activities):

* __Salinas High School - Hopkins Marine Station Internship Program__
    * Along with my peers Will Gough and Dr. David Cade, I co-run a longform science engagement program between Salinas High School (a public high school in Monterey County primarily serving groups underrepresented in academia and marine science) and Hopkins Marine Station. This program pairs high school students with post-doc and PhD student research mentors at Hopkins for individualized, ~5 month research internships. These internships  provides the first experience in research and marine science for most of the students involved, and culminate in an end-of-program symposium highlighting the outcomes of their research projects.
    
* __Local community engagement via classroom visits, public talks, and exhibits__
    * I regularly share the research process and recent findings with diverse audiences, ranging from elementary and middle school classrooms to the broader general public. In particular, I enjoy engaging audiences via interactive exhibits on our research in Monterey Bay, as these tend to facilitate more open and equal interactions and discussion!

I also enjoy teaching and actively aim to improve as an educator. At Northwestern and Stanford, I have acted as the teaching assistant for courses in marine conservation, field and statistical methods in ecology, and environmental microbiology. I also co-teach a proposal and application-writing summer course for the Monterey Bay Regional REU program, a summer research program with the stated goal of "increas[ing] the number and diversity of students pursuing Ocean Sciences careers."
