Outreach and education are central to my personal goals as both a scientist and citizen. These activities, with an emphasis on equitable and inclusive approaches, are inseperable from improving research and conservation efforts in the environmental sciences. Without a focus on including diverse voices and perspectives, we fall well short of the most just and innovative outcomes in our field. Much like with my research, I aim to consistently educate myself in these areas while also putting what I learn into practice. My major outreach and education efforts are detailed below (see CV for a complete list of outreach activities):

* __Monterey Bay REU writing course__
    * Each summer, as a part of the outstanding broader programming offered through the [Monterey Bay Regional Ocean Science Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program](https://csumb.edu/reu) at CSUMB, I co-teach a course focused on the graduate school application process, graduate fellowships, and proposal writing. This REU program has the stated goal of "increas[ing] the number and diversity of students pursuing Ocean Sciences careers," which we focus on in this course aimed at bringing clarity to the often-opaque processes of grad school applications and funding.
    
* __Salinas High School - Hopkins Marine Station Internship Program__
    * Along with my peers Will Gough and Dr. David Cade, I co-run a longform science engagement program between Salinas High School and Hopkins Marine Station. This program pairs high school students with post-doc and PhD student research mentors at Hopkins for individualized, ~5 month research internships. These hands-on internships culminate in an end-of-program symposium highlighting the outcomes of the students' research projects.
 
* __Local community engagement via classroom visits, public talks, and exhibits__
    * I regularly share the research process and recent findings with diverse audiences, ranging from elementary and middle school classrooms to the broader general public. In particular, I enjoy engaging audiences via interactive exhibits on our research in Monterey Bay, as these tend to facilitate more open and equal interactions and discussion!

I have also served as the teaching assistant for several course at Northwestern and Stanford, including marine conservation, field and statistical methods in ecology, and environmental microbiology. Currently I am working on creating my own course in marine conservation, with a greater focus on amplifying the perspectives of stakeholder groups that are often marginalized in negotiations and conversations surrounding marine resource management.
