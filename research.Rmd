For my PhD thesis research, I explore the connections between individual and population-level behavior (social cues) and between population-level behavior and environment (oceanographic drivers). I primarily study these processes in the NE Pacific blue whale population, which provides a unique study system for questions of social and collective behavior due to (1) their ability to communicate over vast distances; (2) their very low population density; (3) their highly-migratory and capital breeding life history; and (4) their extremely dynamic and expansive oceanographic habitat. 

I also interrogate the viability of combining real-time information on animal behavior with information on human resource use to manage multiple uses of marine (and sometimes terrestrial!) ecosystems dynamically in space and time.

In this work, I am co-advised by [Dr. Jeremy Goldbogen](https://goldbogen.stanford.edu/) and [Dr. Larry Crowder](https://crowderlab.stanford.edu/) and collaborate closely with researchers at the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)](https://www.mbari.org/technology/solving-challenges/persistent-presence/mars-hydrophone/).

My interests in connecting environmental variability, animal behavior, and human-wildlife interactions extend beyond the blue whale focus of my dissertation to a variety of relevant research projects and collaborations. Some of my other current projects include:


* __Environmental justice in protecting Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ)__
(Project collaborator; led by Millie Chapman)
    * This project focuses on a critical assessment of optimization schemes for protecting the high seas. Many science and advocacy organizations tout "30% protection of ABNJ by 2030", but whose values are reflected in the algorithmic approaches to selecting this 30%? We focus on injecting concepts of environmental justice into protecting ABNJ in order to promote more equitable management of open sea habitats.

* __Various projects on collective behavior, social cues, foraging, and migration in pelagic predator populations__ (Via collaboration with researchers such as Dr. Briana Abrahms, Dr. Steph Dodson, Dr. Elliott Hazen, Dr. Matt Savoca, Dr. Dave Cade, James Fahlbusch, Danelle Cline, and many more)
    * Collaborative projects under this umbrella include combining bioacoustic, biologging, individual-based modeling, oceanographic, and machine learning tools to understand the social and collective behaviors of pelagic populations (often rorqual whales) in relation to variable environmental conditions.
    
#\newline

* __Moving beyond adaptive capacity to understand observable small-scale fishing community responses to environmental change__ (Project co-lead with members of the Crowder Lab)
    * This primarily social science project aims to build upon adaptive capacity literature by documenting, comparing, and understanding observed responses of small-scale fishing communities around the globe to environmental change. Both a published book chapter and a manuscript in review communicate our findings.

#\newline 

* __Improving and expanding biodiversity surveys for the [National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](https://www.neonscience.org/) via machine learning__ (Project collaborator; led by Dr. Justin Kitzes)
    * This terrestrial ecosystem-focused project aims to improve the capabilities of NEON via new instrumentation and methods. I contribute primarily to improvements in passive acoustic monitoring.

#\newline 

* And more on bioacoustics, migration, and natural resource management!

This context enriches our understanding of population-level call patterns detected via application of machine learning and energy detection techniques to continuous data from MBARI's [MARS hydrophone](https://www.mbari.org/at-sea/cabled-observatory/mars-science-experiments/mars-hydrophone-data/).\label{figurelabel}](images/tag2.png)

Before my research at Stanford, I conducted a variety of research projects in biological oceanography and marine ecology as a BS/MS student (Northwestern) and research technician (WHOI):

* Quantification of mesoscale spatial variability and error of ocean color measurements from the MODIS/Aqua and SeaWiFS satellites.

#\newline 

* Refinement of our understanding of the effects of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) source on its quantification, and the ramifications for light attenuation modeling in coastal oceans.

#\newline 

* Development and application of a coral bleaching response index (BRI) for cross-comparison of bleaching records on disparate scales from around the globe.
