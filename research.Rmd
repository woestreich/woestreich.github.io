In my PhD thesis research, I explore social and environmental drivers of foraging and migratory behavior in the NE Pacific blue whale population. In this work, I focus on linking patterns of individual and population-level behavior, and connecting these patterns to regional oceanography. Blue whales provide a unique study system for questions of the interaction between environment and social and collective behavior due to (1) their ability to communicate over vast distances; (2) their low population density; (3) their highly-migratory and capital breeding life history; and (4) their extremely dynamic and expansive oceanographic habitat. 

I also interrogate the equity and viability of modern approaches (e.g., optimization algorithms, dynamic management) to managing ecosystems and natural resources. This work includes considering human dimensions and equity in marine resource management, and understanding the viability of managing ecosystems dynamically in space and time.

In this work, I am co-advised by [Dr. Larry Crowder](https://crowderlab.stanford.edu/) and [Dr. Jeremy Goldbogen](https://goldbogen.stanford.edu/), and collaborate closely with researchers at the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)](https://www.mbari.org/technology/solving-challenges/persistent-presence/mars-hydrophone/).

My interests in connecting environmental variability, animal behavior, and human-wildlife interactions extend beyond the blue whale focus of my dissertation to a variety of relevant research projects and collaborations. Some of my other current projects include:


* __Considering human equity in the protection Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ)__
(Project co-lead with Millie Chapman)
  
#\newline  

* __Various projects on collective behavior, social cues, foraging, and migration in pelagic predator populations__ (Via collaboration with researchers such as Dr. Briana Abrahms, Dr. Steph Dodson, Dr. Elliott Hazen, Dr. Matt Savoca, Dr. Dave Cade, James Fahlbusch, Danelle Cline, and many more)
    
#\newline

* __Moving beyond adaptive capacity to understand observable small-scale fishing community responses to environmental change__ (Project co-lead with members of the Crowder Lab)

#\newline 

* And more on bioacoustics, migration, and natural resource management!

This context enriches our understanding of population-level call patterns detected via application of machine learning and energy detection techniques to continuous data from MBARI's [MARS hydrophone](https://www.mbari.org/at-sea/cabled-observatory/mars-science-experiments/mars-hydrophone-data/).\label{figurelabel}](images/tag2.png)

Before my research at Stanford, I conducted a variety of research projects in biological oceanography and marine ecology as a BS/MS student (Northwestern) and research technician (WHOI):

* Quantification of mesoscale spatial variability and error of ocean color measurements from the MODIS/Aqua and SeaWiFS satellites.

#\newline 

* Refinement of our understanding of the effects of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) source on its quantification, and the ramifications for light attenuation modeling in coastal oceans.

#\newline 

* Development and application of a coral bleaching response index (BRI) for cross-comparison of bleaching records on disparate scales from around the globe.
